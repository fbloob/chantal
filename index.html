<ul>
<li>At Starbucks, orders a venti cold brew, 4 pumps of sugar free cinnamon dolce and a splash of cream plus egg bites. She acknowledges it’s a crappy choice but, eh.</li>
<li>Feels a bit better, cough is gone but she’s still fatigued and has a big painful lump on the right side of her neck where some lymph nodes are. She had it checked but the doctor didn’t think it was anything.</li>
<li>Promises to get to vlog schedule, acknowledges she’s not good at it.</li>
<li>Shopping for drain cleaner and roach stuff. Says she cleaned up two roach nests in her kitchen, her building is infested.</li>
<li>Says the egg bites give her egg farts and egg shits</li>
<li>Babbles about the stuffed hysterectomy Peetz have her. Says she’s “for sure” having surgery but has to see doctors for pretests.</li>
<li>The “nectrotized” comment may indicate a blood clot in her lung that resolved, left scar tissue</li>
<li>Bibi has the weekend off and she’s making dinner for him and his friend, a beef curry</li>

<li>Going to some crunchy-sounding grocery store because she doesn’t have anything else to do</li>
<li>Admits some of her past behavior was bad, that she was a bitch, looking forward to her surgery - she has to have a vertical incision because of past surgery and it’ll mean a longer healing process. Lots of babbling about her doctors and man, is she dumb</li>
<li>Whining that a doctor she was saw “condescending” about her weight, that no one went over her CT results, said anything about the needle biopsy on her lungs, admits it could be her fault for not dealing with the cysts earlier but then goes on to blame her doctor for telling her she could try holistic things, etc., firstI</li>
<li>Says today will be a “talky” video</li>
<li>Acknowledges she’s making her family worry, her grandma cry. Says she’s helping take care of her grandma, cooking, cleaning her house and doing her laundry even though granny is worried she’s not well enough</li>
<li>Oh Christ, talking about needing to go to the bathroom because coffee gives her the shits</li>
<li>More yapping. Now talking about getting stuck in an old elevator at Sears</li>
<li>Yay, a shit story! She had to go #2 but there were people in the bathroom and she was waiting for them to leave but they didn’t so she just crapped and kept flushing so no one could hear</li>
<li>Bought a lot of fruit, stuff for salads, cheese, salami, olives, guacamole for the diet her doctor recommended</li>
<li>Please make it stop, she’s completely manic and rambling</li>
<li>Giving a sleep apnea PSA, says she’s “legitimately concerned” for some YouTubers (probably looking at you, Hamber)</li>
<li>Talking about how she didn’t want to live sometimes before she started her psychiatric meds</li>
<li>Ha, getting snarky about fatties who use scooters</li>
<li>Says she can’t restrict/eliminate whole food groups, says she’s not going to eat ranch dressing right now though. Eating disorder doctor told her she could have had small piece of cake at her grandpa’s birthday</li>
<li>Eating salad, tomato, plum vinegar, salami, Swiss cheese, Brazil nuts, guacamole, avocado</li>
<li>Took a nap, Bibi and his friend went out instead of her cooking (she thinks, says she “blacked out”)</li>
<li>The swelling in her neck appears to be gone</li>
<li>If she cooks, she’ll put the recipe up tomorrow</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="livestream-aug-15">Livestream (Aug 15)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Marisa L and Karatejoe are the mods this evening.</li>
<li>Says she’s had a fly in her mouth before, and says so with a smile on her face.</li>
<li>SCHAM is beezin’ off camera. Here comes Chantal’s demon voice.</li>
<li>Sam is looking out the window, dreaming of freedom.</li>
<li>She hasn’t seen Peetz all week but doesn’t say why.</li>
<li>Demon voice again.</li>
<li>Says she hasn’t deleted any videos recently. Hmm…</li>
<li>Says her cysts were diagnosed with an ultrasound, and she had her period for 2 months straight.</li>
<li>God please stop talking to the cat. That poor animal looks so sad.</li>
<li>“I don’t have trouble swallowing” We know, that’s why you’re over 400lbs.</li>
<li>She has a “virus infection” right now.</li>
<li>Pink Fairy has entered the chat.</li>
<li>Please stop talking to Sam.</li>
<li>Babbling about TV shows she likes.</li>
<li>Talking about Johnathan Brandis’ suicide.</li>
<li>“I need to pee really bad” but doesn’t get up right away.</li>
<li>Chat is painfully slow and boring. Just like Chantal.</li>
<li>Been in the bathroom for a while.</li>
<li>Demon voice.</li>
<li>I don’t think I’ve heard her say “eh” this much before.</li>
<li>She said she normally doesn’t have trouble breathing. LOL</li>
<li>Mod Annie P has entered the chat.</li>
<li>Had a dream that she couldn’t find a car and she screamed at someone about it. Even in her own dreams she’s a rude bitch.</li>
<li>“I don’t get people being ashamed of her age” Unless I missed it she hasn’t stated her age during this stream.</li>
<li>Karatejoe declares, “NO asking for ages here” Uh, why?</li>
<li>Demon voice.</li>
<li>Karatejoe: “@BIg Beautiful Me you left your car at my place in your dream.” Wtf?</li>
<li>“It’s hard to tell if they look swollen because of my… chin.” She’s talking about her lymph nodes and gorl we can’t tell because you’re fat.</li>
<li>Chat is speculation what infection she could have.</li>
<li>“I’ve neglected my friends.” Mentions Rina and Peetz, doesn’t get specific about anyone else, just “other friends”.</li>
<li>“I don’t do much for my birthdays anymore.” Yeah I imagine it’s not fun to celebrate on your own after being so terrible to everyone in your life.</li>
<li>Brings up the bachelorette party video. Pity invites don’t count as a sign of friendship.</li>
<li>Says that Bibi is at work until midnight.</li>
<li>Chantal doesn’t seem to be able to pronounce Malan correctly. Great sign of a loving long-term relationship.</li>
<li>“I just always call him Bibi” Why though?</li>
<li>Chantal thinks that the sister is staying until December. Mark your calendars, if Chantal is still alive something interesting might happen.</li>
<li>Says she hasn’t been singing lately, but wants to get back into it.</li>
<li>Says her grandpa is American. Says he could sponsor her so she could try to get on American Idol.</li>
<li>“I don’t talk about other YouTubers on here.”</li>
<li>“If I got boo’d I wouldn’t care. Whatever.”</li>
<li>“Pewdiepie is very good looking, that’s all I can say.” <em>You literally just said you don’t talk about other YouTubers.</em></li>
<li>“Fried cheese curds? Sounds like diarrhea to me.” Why is everything diarrhea with this woman?</li>
<li>Sounds confused about her visit to the doctor.</li>
<li>“I think it’s an infection.” She’s said this several times.</li>
<li>Mod Sara Jane’s Journey entered at some point. You don’t need that many mods for 142 viewers with less than 10 people active in chat.</li>
<li>Hearing her talk about TV and movies is so boring. Even she sounds bored.</li>
<li>Some how her breathing has gotten heavier the longer she’s idle.</li>
<li>Someone gave her $5USD. Ugh.</li>
<li>Now she’s talking about Vagisil and washing her crotch. So gross.</li>
<li>Demon voice: “YOU’RE OBESE! YOU NEED KETO!” Bitch is insane.</li>
<li>Says she used to go to a bar meant for older women who want to pick up younger men. Surprise, Bibi also went to that bar.</li>
<li>Sam is asleep and she won’t stop taking to him.</li>
<li>Karatejoe is getting pissy at everyone over spoiling Netflix movies, but no one spoiled anything.</li>
<li>“I don’t have anything to watch.” But you were just talking about Netflix movies you haven’t seen.</li>
<li>For some reason Sam is standing on her. Maybe he wants her to shut up.</li>
<li>Chantal says Sam is 2 years old.</li>
<li>He seems to be genuinely enjoying the attention.</li>
<li>She really wants everyone to notice how Sam suckles her fat roll. Nasty.</li>
<li>Chantal says “LOOK AT THIS PIT SNIFFER!” for the millionth time.</li>
<li>Now she says she hasn’t seen Peetz because she’s been sick.</li>
<li>Getting real tired of that demon voice.</li>
<li>“I think I’m gonna go to bed soon.” “I’m pretty exhausted.” Lol from what?</li>
<li>Doesn’t know why she doesn’t feel good. Being morbidly obese couldn’t possibly have anything to do with it, right?</li>
